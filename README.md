# DefaultDetect-StatInfer

A statistical data analysis project focused on identifying high-risk customers likely to default on a loan using real-world data and key concepts from statistical inference.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the **Statistical Inference and Data Analysis** course. Our goal was to perform a thorough statistical investigation on a financial dataset to uncover patterns associated with loan default risks.

Through a combination of univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis, we were able to draw meaningful conclusions about the traits and behaviors of high-risk customers using Python and key data science libraries.

## 📊 Objectives

- Apply **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand feature distributions and relationships.
- Use **confidence intervals** to estimate feature ranges.
- Perform **hypothesis testing** and **A/B testing** to validate assumptions.
- Implement **regression analysis** to model key relationships.
- Apply **estimation theory** (bias, variance, and sampling distributions) for better inference.

## 🧠 Techniques & Concepts Applied

- Univariate & Bivariate EDA
- Correlation Heatmaps
- Confidence Interval Estimation
- Hypothesis Testing (Z-test, T-test)
- A/B Testing Techniques
- Linear Regression Modeling
- Estimators, Bias-Variance Tradeoff
- Statistical Conclusions & Inference

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- **Python**  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – Data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **SciPy**, **statsmodels**, **scikit-learn** – Statistical analysis and modeling  

## 🔍 Key Outcome

By combining statistical theory with practical implementation, we were able to build a statistically sound **default risk profile**—a set of key indicators that suggest a customer is more likely to default.

## 📈 Sample Insights

 • A male customer is more likely to default than a female customer.
 • People with a relationship status of other are more likely to default than married 
or single people.
 • A customer whose highest educational qualification is a high-school diploma 
is more likely to default than a customer who has gone to graduate school 
or university.
 • A customer who has delayed payment for 2 consecutive months has a higher 
probability of default.
 • A customer who is 22 years of age has a higher probability of defaulting on 
payments than any other age group.
